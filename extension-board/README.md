acquisition-board-extension-board
=================

this is not a finished or tested design yet!

Description
----------------
The Open Ephys acquisition extension-board is designed to plug into an existing acquisition board in order to provide
- an additional 8 channels of digital inputs via a 2nd HDMI connector for a total of 16 channels of digital input.
- an additional 4 SPI headstone connectors for a total capacity of up to 16 RHD chips for a maximum number of 1024 channels of neural data.

Details
----------

We have a few free pins left on the fpga that we pulled out to a .1" header on the acquisition board, for future expansions so with a few cmos<>lvds bridges (because we dont have enough pins for straight lvds - and this is assuming that the bandwidth of these is not destroyed by the board layout etc) we can theoretically throw in a 2nd row of 4 ports, which would get us to 1024 chs per board. Of course this would require some firmware, api, and GUI updates, 


This requires a USB3.0 FPGA module, i'm not 100% sure how close this would come to saturating the usb3, though it should fit in theory ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+byte+*+30kHz+*+1024+*+2+in+MB%2Fs ).



File types
------------
- .ai = Adobe Illustrator files; contain images of hardware
- .brd = EAGLE board files; describe the physical layout of the printed circuit board
- .sch = EAGLE schematic files; describe the electrical connections of the printed circuit board
- .cam = EAGLE export files; contain instructions for translating between the .brd file and Gerber files
- .png = image files
- BOM.txt = contains link to Bill of Materials in a Google Doc
- BOM.csv = text file containing all the necessary parts; can be viewed in Excel or any text editor
- .md = Markdown files; most likely a README file; can be viewed with any text edtior
- "gerber" files (.top, .bsk, .oln, etc.) = contain machine-readable instructions for creating the printed circuit board; these are sent to a fab house (such as Sunstone Circuits) for PCB production
- .SLDPRT files = SolidWorks part files; contain CAD models of 3D components
- .STL files = stereolithography files; can be sent to a rapid prototyping service (such as Shapeways) to create 3D objects
- .eps files = specify design of acrylic top for laser cutting
