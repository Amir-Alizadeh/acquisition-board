Description
----------------
The Open Ephys acquisition board provides a convenient USB interface between up to four headstages and a computer. It features 8 channels of digital input, to sync acquisition with external devices, and 8 channels of digital output, to trigger optogenetic stimulation or behavioral feedback.

Details
----------
The Open Ephys headstages are powerful, but they can't run on their own. They need to receive precisely coordinated control signals that synchronize the Intan chip with the onboard analog-to-digital converter. The best way to generate these signals is with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip that can be instantly reconfigured to simulate multiple analog circuits in parallel. An FPGA inside the acquisition board is what controls the headstages and sends their data to a computer. Since the headstages can't be plugged directly into the Opal Kelly board, we needed to add a custom printed circuit board to relay neural data to the FPGA. And because we wanted the whole package to be easy on the eyes, we designed a case that can be 3D printed or CNC machined.

Current specifications
-----------------------------
- Simultaneous acquisition from 4 headstages (128 channels total)
- up to 30 kHz sampling rate
- 8 digital inputs controlled via software
- 8 digital outputs controlled via software
- 8 bidirectional ADCs (+/- 5V)
- 8 DACs (+/- 5V)
- USB 2.0, USB 3.0, or PCI express communication (depending on the Opal Kelly FPGA that is used)
- 8 full-spectrum indicator LEDs

File types
------------
- .ai = Adobe Illustrator files; contain images of hardware
- .brd = EAGLE board files; describe the physical layout of the printed circuit board
- .sch = EAGLE schematic files; describe the electrical connections of the printed circuit board
- .cam = EAGLE export files; contain instructions for translating between the .brd file and Gerber files
- BOM.txt = Bill of Materials; contains part numbers for all components (from DigiKey unless otherwise specified)
- .md = Markdown files; most likely a README file; can be viewed with any text edtior
- "gerber" files (.top, .bsk, .oln, etc.) = contain machine-readable instructions for creating the printed circuit board; these are sent to a fab house (such as Sunstone Circuits) for PCB production
- .SLDPRT files = SolidWorks part files; contain CAD models of 3D components
- .STL files = stereolithography files; can be sent to a rapid prototyping service (such as Shapeways) to create 3D objects
