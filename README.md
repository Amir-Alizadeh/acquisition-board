Description
----------------
The Open Ephys acquisition board provides a convenient USB interface between up to four headstages and a computer. It features 8 channels of digital input, to sync acquisition with external devices, and 8 channels of digital output, to trigger optogenetic stimulation or behavioral feedback. 

Cost of raw materials: $883.39
Time to build: 3 hours

Details
----------
The Open Ephys headstages are powerful, but they can't run on their own. They need to receive precisely coordinated control signals that synchronize the Intan chip with the onboard analog-to-digital converter. The best way to generate these signals is with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip that can be instantly reconfigured to simulate multiple analog circuits in parallel. An FPGA inside the acquisition board is what controls the headstages and sends their data to a computer. Since the headstages can't be plugged directly into the Opal Kelly board, we needed to add a custom printed circuit board to relay neural data to the FPGA. And because we wanted the whole package to be easy on the eyes, we designed a case that can be 3D printed or CNC machined.

Current specifications
-----------------------------
- Simultaneous acquisition from 2 headstages (64 channels total)
- 28 kHz sampling rate
- 8 digital inputs sampled at the same frequency as neural data
- USB 2.0 communication
- 8 tricolor indicator LEDs

Anticipated specifications
----------------------------------
- Simultaneous acquisition from 4 headstages (128 channels total)
- 30 kHz sampling rate
- 8 digital outputs controlled via software
- 8 variable-range analog inputs (up to +/- 15V)
- Optical isolation for all digital inputs and outputs
- USB 2.0, USB 3.0, or PCI express communication (depending on the Opal Kelly FPGA that is used)
- 8 full-spectrum indicator LEDs

Known issues
-------------------
- There are no current-limiting resistors in series with the optocouplers; until these are added, the optocouplers must be bypassed with individual wires for each channel
- All three channels of the RGB LEDs are connected to ground via the same 330 Ohm resistor. This means only one channel can be active at a time. To achieve color mixtures, we'll need to add two additional resistors for each LED.
- There's no impedance matching resistor on the clock output; this is causing significant signal reflections when a BNC cable is plugged in

File types
------------
File types:
.ai = Adobe Illustrator files; contain images of hardware
.brd = EAGLE board files; describe the physical layout of the printed circuit board
.sch = EAGLE schematic files; describe the electrical connections of the printed circuit board
.cam = EAGLE export files; contain instructions for translating between the .brd file and Gerber files
BOM.txt = Bill of Materials; contains part numbers for all components (from DigiKey unless otherwise specified)
.md = Markdown files; most likely a README file; can be viewed with any text edtior
"gerber" files (.top, .bsk, .oln, etc.) = contain machine-readable instructions for creating the printed circuit board; these are sent to a fab house (such as Sunstone Circuits) for PCB production
.SLDPRT files = SolidWorks part files; contain CAD models of 3D components
.STL files = stereolithography files; can be sent to a rapid prototyping service (such as Shapeways) to create 3D objects
.eps file = encapsulated postscript files; describe the shape of laser-cut parts (Ponoko only). Can be edited in Adobe Illustrator.

DISCLAIMER: We don't recommend using any of the tools from Open Ephys for actual experiments until they've been tested more thoroughly. If you'd like to know which tests we've run or plan to run, please get in touch with us via the Open Ephys [contact](http://open-ephys.com/contact/) page.
